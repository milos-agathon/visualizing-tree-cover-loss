# Visualizing-tree-cover-loss
This repo demonstrates how to apply zonal statistics to Sentinel-2 10m Land Use/Land Cover Time Series satellite data to compute and visualize tree cover change between 2018 and 2022 using R.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- Download and preprocess Sentinel-2 10m Land Use/Land Cover Time Series satellite data for a region of interest.
- Apply zonal statistics to calculate the percentage change of tree cover for each administrative unit in the region.
- Compare the results for different years and identify the areas with the most significant changes in tree cover.
- Visualize the results using ggplot2
